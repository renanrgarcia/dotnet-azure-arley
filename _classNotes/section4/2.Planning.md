# Sprint Planning

- **Sprint Planning** is a time-boxed event that occurs at the beginning of a Sprint. It is a collaborative effort involving the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and the Development Team. The purpose of Sprint Planning is to define what can be delivered in the Sprint and how that work will be achieved. It is a time for the team to come together and agree on the work they will commit to completing during the Sprint.
- **Sprint Planning** is divided into two parts:
  - **Part One**: The team reviews the Product Backlog and selects the items they will work on during the Sprint. The team then creates a Sprint Goal, which is a high-level objective that the team will work towards during the Sprint. The team also creates User Stories, which are detailed descriptions of the work that needs to be done to achieve the Sprint Goal.
  - **Part Two**: The team creates a plan for how they will achieve the Sprint Goal. This plan includes breaking down the selected Product Backlog items into smaller tasks, estimating the effort required to complete each task, and creating a Sprint Backlog that lists all the work that needs to be done during the Sprint.
- After, the team will point the tasks and create a burndown chart to track the progress of the Sprint.
  - The team will evaluate if they can deliver the Sprint Goal and the selected items during the Sprint. If not, they will adjust the scope of the Sprint or the Sprint Goal accordingly, both adding or removing items from the Sprint Backlog.

## Tasks Estimation

- Do not estimate tasks in hours. Instead, use story points.
- Story points are a relative unit of measure that represent the effort required to complete a task. They are used to estimate the size of a task relative to other tasks.
- The Fibonacci sequence is commonly used to assign story points to tasks: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.
  - The team must determine the maximum number of story points that can be assigned to a task. If a task is too big, it should be broken down into smaller tasks.
- Use `Poker Planning` to estimate tasks. Each team member selects a card that represents the story points they think a task is worth. The team then discusses their estimates and comes to a consensus on the story points for each task.
