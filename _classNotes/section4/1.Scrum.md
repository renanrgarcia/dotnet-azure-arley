# Scrum

- Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

- **Development Team**: A cross-functional group of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.
